Fashion is a popular style, especially in clothing, footwear, lifestyle, accessories, makeup, hairstyle and body.[citation needed] 
Fashion is a distinctive and often constant trend in the style in which people present themselves. 
A fashion can become the prevailing style in behaviour or manifest the newest creations of designers, technologists, engineers, and
design managers.
Because the more technical term costume is regularly linked to the term "fashion", the use of the former has been relegated to special
senses like fancy-dress or masquerade wear, while the word "fashion" often refers to clothing, including the study of clothing.
Although aspects of fashion can be feminine or masculine, some trends are androgynous.
High-flying trendsetters in fashion can aspire to the label haute couture. But if one disapproves of a fashion, one can attempt to dismiss
it as a mere fad.Early Western travelers, traveling whether to India, Persia, Turkey or China, would frequently remark on the absence of 
change in fashion in those countries.The Japanese sh≈çgun's secretary bragged (not completely accurately) to a Spanish visitor in 1609 that
Japanese clothing had not changed in over a thousand years However, there is considerable evidence in Ming China of rapidly changing fashions
in Chinese clothing. Changes in costume often took place at times of economic or social change, as occurred in ancient Rome and the medieval
Caliphate, followed by a long period without major changes.
