<h1>ALL ABOUT FASHION</h1>
<pre>
Fashion is a popular style, especially in clothing, footwear, lifestyle, accessories, makeup, hairstyle and body.[citation needed] Fashion is a distinctive and often constant trend in the style in which people present themselves. A fashion can become the prevailing style in behaviour or manifest the newest creations of designers, technologists, engineers, and design managers.[1][need quotation to verify]
Because the more technical term costume is regularly linked[by whom?] to the term "fashion", the use of the former has been relegated to special senses like fancy-dress or masquerade wear, while the word "fashion" often refers to clothing, including the study of clothing. Although aspects of fashion can be feminine or masculine, some trends are androgynous.[2][3]
High-flying trendsetters in fashion can aspire to the label haute couture. But if one disapproves of a fashion, one can attempt to dismiss it as a mere fad.
